# MentalSoft-Paint-V1
my very first actual project in c++ lol idk what else to say except maybe some day in the future i can come back to this and cringe at my code (:

oh, also
the dimensions and stuff probably will get messed up bc i hadn't really taken that into consideration, it was kinda made to work for me in my terminal (in fullscreen)
